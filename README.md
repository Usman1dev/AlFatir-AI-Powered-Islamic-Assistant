## ⚙️ Installation & Setup Guide

To get the full experience (including the AI Chatbot), you need to set up the **Backend** first, then the **Flutter App**.

### Part 1: Backend Setup (RAG Chatbot)

The AI features require the separate RAG Chatbot server to be running.

1. **Clone the Chatbot Repository**:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/daniyalsalman/rag_chatbot.git](https://github.com/daniyalsalman/rag_chatbot.git)
cd rag_chatbot

```


2. **Set up Python Environment**:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```


3. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


4. **Setup Ollama (Required for AI)**:
* Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
* Pull the required models:
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:1b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

```


* Start the Ollama service: `ollama serve`


5. **Run the API Server**:
```bash
python api.py

```


*The server will start at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`. Keep this terminal open.*

### Part 2: Mobile App Setup (Flutter)

1. **Clone the Al-Fatir Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Usman1dev/AlFatir-AI-Powered-Islamic-Assistant.git
cd AlFatir-AI-Powered-Islamic-Assistant

```


2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
flutter pub get

```


3. **Configure Network (Important)**:
* **Android Emulator**: The app is pre-configured to reach the backend at `http://10.0.2.2:8000`.
* **Real Device**: Update `lib/rag_chat_sreen.dart` with your PC's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.x:8000`).


4. **Run the App**:
```bash
flutter run

```
